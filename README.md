4th Module Challenge Boot Camp

Done with past class activities on the side for reference

Javascript help from my father:

Making the keepTheme function outside of the darkLightSwitch to call for it after let mode

A lot of the CSS was referenced from my second challenge: https://github.com/Kahlium/ReallyTheSecondChallenge
